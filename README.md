## PheroComNetwork

PheroComNetwork represents a data set of simulations that models the evolution of the communications of a swarm of robots in the surveillance task, including eventual failures.

## Network description

The "complex_network.dat" contains the graph mapped in this simulations, with:

* 12 nodes (robots) 
* 63,743 edges, distributed in 7 visiting cycles

There is a total of 20 failures: 

* 14 robot failures 
* 04 cluster failures and 
* 02 swarm failures. 
 
The environment is composed of 40 rooms and dimensions equal to 9600 cells.
